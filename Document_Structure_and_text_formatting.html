    <blockquote>Life is beautiful. Yet, much of the beauty is lost in our unfulfilled desire. In this short life we want to achieve too many things. We want money, we want gold, we want fame – quite often without thinking whether it is within our reach or not. Often our ambition is out of bound to our available resource, ability and capability. When we fail to achieve, we blame our fate, we blame others for betraying us or not helping us enough. In this way we come to a grief and frustration. We complain about pain, criticize about mosquitoes, snow, and silly people; we lapse into doubt and cynicism. We die every day for some reason or other. Quite the reverse, happy are those who come alive every day. One 5-year study indicate that there seems to be a 35% decrease in the risk of dying among people, who reported being happy every day, excited on a typical day and contend with whatever they have, compared to those, who are sadder or more anxious.
